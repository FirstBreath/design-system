## About

The FirstBreath Design System is a collection of reusable UI components built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and *
*Styled Components**. This system helps maintain visual consistency and simplifies the development process by offering
pre-built and easily customizable components that are tailored for FirstBreath applications.

## Getting Started

To use the FirstBreath Design System in your project, follow the installation guide below. We also recommend browsing
the documentation for detailed descriptions of each component and usage examples.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- Package manager: **Yarn** (preferred) or **npm**

## Installation

Install the design system package into your project using **Yarn**:

```bash
yarn add @firstbreath/design-system --save
```

Or with **npm**:

```bash
npm install @firstbreath/design-system --save
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the components in your application. Here's a simple example of importing and using a
button component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import {Button} from '@firstbreath/design-system';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <Button variant="primary">Click Me</Button>
        </div>
    );
};

export default App;
```

### Theming

The design system is built to be themable. You can easily extend or override default styles to match your brand. Check
the documentation for instructions on customizing themes.
